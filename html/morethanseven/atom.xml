    <id>http://www.morethanseven.net/2013/04/23/web-application-security-tools</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve become increasingly interested in web application security issues over the last year or so. Working in Government will do that to you. And I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that a) there are lots of good open source security tools, b) many of them are terribly packaged and c) most developers don&#8217;t use any of them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been having related conversations at recent events I&#8217;ve made it along to, including Devopsdays London which featured some good open spaces discussions on the subject. Security is one of those areas that, for many organisations, is basically outsourced to third party penetration testing firms or consultants. Specialists definitely have a role to play, but with a move towards increasingly rapid releases I think in-house security testing and monitoring is going to get more and more important.</p>
<h2>A collection of security tools</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve started to build a <a href="https://github.com/garethr/pentesting-playground">collection of tools on GitHub</a>, along with a vagrant setup to test them out. Full instructions are available on that repository but the short version is you can run one command and have one virtual machine filled with security testing tools and, if useful, another machine running a vulnerable web application with which to test. The current list of tools runs to:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/skipfish/">skipfish</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://nmap.org/">nmap</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.cirt.net/nikto2">nikto</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://w3af.org/">w3af</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/Garmr">garmr</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/sslyze">sslyze</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/metachris/wpscanner">wpscanner</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project">owasp zap</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://arachni-scanner.com/">arachni</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/gauntlt/gauntlt">gauntlt</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://sqlmap.org/">sqlmap</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://wpscan.org/">wpscan</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sslscan/">sslscan</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.taddong.com/2013/02/tlssled-v13.html">TLSSLed</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But I&#8217;ll add more tools as I discover them or as people file issues or pull requests.</p>
<h2>What about Backtrack?</h2>
<p>When I started investigating tools for security and penetration testing most roads led to <a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/">Backtrack</a>. This is a complete Linux distribution packed with a huge number of security tools, including many if not all of the above. Why then did I write puppet code rather than create a Vagrant box from Backtrack? Firstly, Backtrack is probably great if you&#8217;re a professional penetration tester, but the barrier to entry to installing a new distibution for most developers is too high in my view. And with a view to using some of these tools as part of monitoring systems I don&#8217;t always want a separate virtual machine. I want to be able to install the tools wherever I want. A good configuration management tool gives you that portability, and Vagrant gives you all the benefits of a local virtual machine.</p>
<h2>Future plans</h2>
<p>As mentioned I&#8217;d like to expand how some of these tools are used to include automated monitoring of applications, maybe look at ways of extracting data for metrics or possibily writing a Sensu plugin or two. The first step to that is probably breaking down the monolithic puppet manifest into separate modules for each tool. Along the way I can add support for more operating systems as required. I&#8217;ve already done that for the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr/wackopicko">wackopicko module which is up on the Forge</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also soliciting any and all feedback, especially from developers who don&#8217;t do any security related testing but feel like they should.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve not been writing many blog posts lately, but I have been doing quite a bit of writing elsewhere. One of the things I&#8217;ve had a hand in at work is the new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual">Government Service Design Manual</a>. This is the work of many people I work with as well as further afield. It&#8217;s intended to be a good starting place to find information about building high quality digital services.</p>
<p>The manual is in beta and we&#8217;re looking for as much feedback as possible on the whole thing. It&#8217;s already proving useful and a good way of framing the scope of discussions, but it has lots of room for improvement.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re reading this post I&#8217;m going to wager you&#8217;re interest lies in or around devops flavoured content. The following are guides I&#8217;ve written in this area that I&#8217;d love any and all feedback on.</p>

</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the background to this endeavour then a couple of blog posts from some of my colleagues might be of interest too. First Richard Pope talks about <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2013/03/21/building-the-standard/">how the manual came about</a> and here&#8217;s a post from Andrew Greenway about this <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2013/03/21/building-the-standard/">beta testing of the service standard</a>.</p>
<p>The source for all this is on <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/government-service-design-manual">GitHub</a> so if you prefer you can just sent a pull request. Or I&#8217;m happy to get emails or comments on this post. In particular if people have good references or next steps for these guides then let me know as several of them in particular are lacking in that area.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About a month ago I had the good fortune of speaking at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-Web-Performance-Group/">London Web Performance</a> meetup. This was one of the first talks I&#8217;ve done about our work at The Government Digital Service since the luanch of <span class="caps">GOV</span>.UK back in October. The topic was all about moving quickly in a large organisation (The UK Civil Service is about 450,000 people so I think it counts) and featured just a hand full of technical and organisational tricks we used.</p>

    <id>http://www.morethanseven.net/2012/12/30/my-personal-package-repository</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m a <a href="http://www.morethanseven.net/2011/01/16/Why-developers-should-care-about-system-packages/">big fan of system packages for lots of reasons</a> and have often ended up rolling my own debian package repository at work, or working with others that have done so. Recently I finally got round to setting up a personal package repo, at <a href="http://packages.garethrushgrove.com">packages.garethrushgrove.com</a>. More interesting than the repo is probably the tool chain I used, oh and the rather nice bootstrap based styling.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRjh1wIM" alt="nice looking package repository"/></p>
<p>The source code for everything is <a href="https://github.com/garethr/packages">on GitHub</a> although not much documentation exists yet. In the middle are a few shell scripts that generate the repo. Around them is a Vagrant box (which makes it easier to build packages for different achitectures or distros) and some Rake commands</p>
<pre><code>bundle exec rake -T
rake recipes:build[recipe]  # Build a package from one of the available recipes
rake recipes:list           # List available recipes
rake repo:build             # Build the repository</code></pre>
<p>The recipes commands allow for building new packages based on scripts. A few examples are included which use fpm, but you could use anything. The repo:build command triggers the debian repository to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>The vagrant configuration shares various folders between and guest and host which also opens up a few useful features. One is I can just drop any old debian package into the debs folder and run the repo:build command and it will be in my repository. The other useful capability is that the resulting repo is shared back to the host, which means I can then check it into Git and in my case push it up to Heroku.</p>]]></content>

    <updated>2012-12-03T08:18:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.morethanseven.net/2012/12/03/on-the-forge</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been spending a bit of time recently pushing a few Puppet modules to the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com">Forge</a>. This is Puppetlabs attempt to make a central repository of reusable puppet modules. I started doing it as a bit of an experiment, to find out what I liked and what worked and I decided to writeup a few opinions.</p>
<p>So far I&#8217;ve shipped the following modules:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr/riemann">Riemann</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr/graphite">Graphite</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr/logstash">Logstash</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr/freight">Freight</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Quite a few of these started as forks of other modules but have evolved quite a bit towards being more reusable.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also started sending pull requests for modules that basically do what I want but don&#8217;t always play well with others.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/thomasvandoren/puppet-redis/pull/10">Redis</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Improved tools</h2>
<p>It turns out the experience is mainly a pleasurable one, partly down to the much improved tooling around Puppet. Specifically I&#8217;m making extensive use of:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://rspec-puppet.com/">Rspec Puppet</a> &#8211; for writing tests for module behavious</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet">Librarian Puppet</a> &#8211; dependency management for modules</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs_spec_helper">Puppet spec helper</a> &#8211; conventions and helpers for testing modules</li>
	<li><a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> &#8211; easy continuous integration for module code</li>
	<li><a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> &#8211; manage virtual machines, useful for smoke testing on different distributions</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of those tools make testing Puppet modules both easier and useful. Here&#8217;s an example of one of the above modules being tested. Note that it&#8217;s run across Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2 and 1.9.3 and Puppet versions 2.7.17, 2.7.18 and 3.0.1 for a total of 9 builds. Handily the Redis module mentioned also had a test suite. The pull request includes changes to that, and Travis <a href="https://travis-ci.org/thomasvandoren/puppet-redis/builds/3462513">automatically tested the pull request</a> for the modules author.</p>
<h2>Antipatterns</h2>
<p>Using modules from the Forge really forces you to think about reusability. The pull request mentioned above for the Redis module for instance replaced an explicit mention of the build-essential package with the &#8220;puppetlabs/gcc&#8221;: class from the Forge. This makes the module less self contained, but without that change the module is incompatible with any other module that also uses that common package. I also went back and replaced explicit references to wget and build-essential in my Riemann module.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb. For a specific module only include resources that are unique to the software the module manages. Anything else should be in another module with a dependency in the Modulefile.</p>
<p>This can feel a little much when you&#8217;re replacing a simple Package resource with a whole new module but it has two advantages I care about. As well as the ability to use the module with other third party modules more easily it also makes it more likely that the module will work cross platform.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s missing?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see a few things improved when it comes to the Forge.</p>
<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;d like to be able to publish a new version of a module without having to use the web interface. The current workflow involves running a build command, then uploading the generated artifact via a web form after logging in.</li>
	<li>I&#8217;d like to see best practice module development guides front and centre on the Forge. Lots of modules won&#8217;t work with other modules and I think that&#8217;s fixable.</li>
	<li>Integration with puppet-lint would be nice, giving some indication of whether the authors care about the Puppet styleguide.</li>
	<li><del>A command line search interface would be useful</del>. And <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/man/module.html">turns out to exist</a>. Thanks <a href="http://twitter.com/a1cy">@a1cy</a> for the heads up.</li>
	<li>The Forge tracks number of downloads, but as a publisher I don&#8217;t know how often my modules have been downloaded.</li>
	<li>And finally I&#8217;d like to see more people using it.</li>
</ul>]]></content>

    <link href="http://www.morethanseven.net/2012/08/19/Tale-of-a-grok-pattern/"/>
    <updated>2012-08-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.morethanseven.net/2012/08/19/Tale-of-a-grok-pattern</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m all of a sudden adding lots more code to GitHub. Here&#8217;s the latest project, <a href="https://github.com/garethr/logstash-patterns">grok patterns for logstash</a>. At the moment this repo only contains one new pattern but I&#8217;m hoping to add more, and maybe even for others to add more too.</p>
<p>First, a bit of background. <a href="http://logstash.net/">Logstash</a> is the excellent, open source, log agregation and processing framework. It takes inputs from various configurable places, processes them with filters and then outputs the results. So maybe you&#8217;ll take inputs from various application log files and output then into an elastic search index for easy searching, or output the same inputs to graphite and statsd to get graphs of rates. One of the host powerful filters in logstash is the <a href="http://logstash.net/docs/1.0.17/filters/grok">grok filter</a>. It takes a grok pattern and parses out information contained in the text into fields that can be more easily used by outputs. This post serves hopefully as both an explanation of why and an example of how you might do that.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>Rails logs are horrible, that is until you install the excellent <a href="https://github.com/roidrage/lograge">lograge</a> output formatter. That gives you lines like:</p>
<pre>GET /jobs/833552.json format=json action=jobs#show status=200 duration=58.33 view=40.43 db=15.26</pre>
<p>This contains loads of useful information that&#8217;s easily parsable by a developer. We have the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> status code, the rails controller and information about response time too. A grok filter lets us teach logstash about that information too. The working grok filter for filtering this line looks like this:</p>
<h2>The solution</h2>
<pre>LOGRAGE %{WORD:method}%{SPACE}%{DATA}%{SPACE}action=%{WORD:controller}#%{WORD:action}%{SPACE}status=%{INT:status}%{SPACE}duration=%{NUMBER:duration}%{SPACE}view=%{NUMBER:view}(%{SPACE}db=%{NUMBER:db})?%{GREEDYDATA}</pre>
<p>That was worked out pretty much with a bit of trial and error and use of the logstash java binary, using stdin and stdout inputs and outputs. It works but getting their wasn&#8217;t that much funand proving it works outside a running logstash setup was tricky. Enter rspec and the grok implementation in pure Ruby. The project above contains an Rspec matcher for use when testing grok filters for logstash. I&#8217;ll probably extract that into a gem at some point but you&#8217;ll get the idea. Now we can write tests like these:</p>
<pre>the lograge grok pattern
  with a standard lograge log line
    should have the correct http method value
    should have the correct value for the request duration
    should have the correct value for the request view time
    should have the correct controller and action
    should have the correct value for db time
  without the db time
    should have the correct value for the request view time
  with a post request
    should have the correct http method value

Finished in 0.01472 seconds
7 examples, 0 failures
</pre>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/garethr/logstash-patterns/blob/master/spec/lograge_spec.rb">tests themselves</a> are just basic Rspec with most of the work done in the <a href="https://github.com/garethr/logstash-patterns/blob/master/spec/spec_helper.rb">custom matcher</a>. This not only means I can be a bit more confident that my grok pattern works, it also provides a much nicer framework for writing more patterns for other log formats. Parsing rules like this are one area where test driven development is a huge boon in my experience. And with tests comes continuous integration, in this case via <a href="http://travis-ci.org/#!/garethr/logstash-patterns">Travis</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll hopefully find myself writing more patterns and tests for them, and if anyone wants to send pull requests and to start collecting working grok patterns together so much the better.</p>]]></content>

    <id>http://www.morethanseven.net/2012/08/11/Riemann-puppet-module</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to an <a href="https://twitter.com/bitprophet/status/233626675307479040">errant tweet</a> I started playing with <a href="http://aphyr.github.com/riemann/">Riemann</a> again. It ticks lots of boxes for me, from the clojure to configuration as code and the overloadable dashboard application. What started as using Puppet and Vagrant to investigate Riemann turned into a full blown tool and module writing exercise, resulting in two related projects on GitHub.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/garethr/garethr-riemann/">garethr-riemann</a> is a Puppet module for installing and configuring Riemann. It allows for easily specifying your own server configuration and dashboard views.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/garethr/riemann-vagrant">riemann-vagrant</a> is a Vagrantfile and other code which uses above puppet module to setup a local testing environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>I like this combination, a separate Puppet module along with a vagrant powered test bed. I&#8217;ve written a reasonable rspec based test suite to check the module but it&#8217;s always easier to be able to run <em>vagrant provision</em> as well to check everything is working. This also turned out to be the perfect opportunity to use <a href="https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet">Librarian-Puppet</a> to manage the dependencies and eventually to ship the module to the <a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr/riemann">Puppet Forge</a>.</p>]]></content>

    <updated>2012-07-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.morethanseven.net/2012/07/01/The-vagrantbox.es-story</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago now <a href="http://www.vagrantbox.es/">Vagrantbox.es</a> (a website I maintain for third party hosted <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> base boxes) dissapeared from the internet for a few days. This was completely my fault, the (lovely) hosting people <a href="https://www.ep.io/">ep.io</a> had unfortunately closed down the service they had in beta and I&#8217;d been so busy that I hadn&#8217;t had chance to move it elsewhere.</p>
<p>The original version of the site (I had the code and good backups of the data) was a pretty simple Django application, but I&#8217;d used it to experiment (read over-engineer) with various bits of tech including Varnish, Solr, some <span class="caps">ORM</span> caching and lots more. This had been great, but it made it less portable. I had everything described in Puppet, but with virtually no spare time I decided to go a different route.</p>
<p>I threw a flat version of the site up on <a href="https://github.com/garethr/vagrantboxes-heroku">GitHub</a>, served it using Nginx on <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> and added a quick <em>Fork me on GitHub</em> badge to the top. Suggest a box moved from being a web form to a pull request. It&#8217;s fair to say I did this pretty quickly and made a good few typos on the way. But within a couple of weeks I&#8217;ve had 8 pull requests either fixing my bugs, removing dead boxes and adding new ones.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m going to take from this is, if you&#8217;re building a community project that&#8217;s aimed at developers, then throw the content on GitHub. In my case I have the entire site on there too but I think that&#8217;s secondary. Pull requests are much better than any content management system or workflow you&#8217;re likely to build, and even more importantly the time to implement something drops hugely.</p>
<p>With all the spare time I don&#8217;t have I&#8217;ll be thinking about a content management model using GitHub for content, pull requests for workflow and post commit hooks for loading that content into a site or service somewhere.</p>]]></content>

    <link href="http://www.morethanseven.net/2012/06/05/Static-sites-with-nginx-on-heroku/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.morethanseven.net/2012/06/05/Static-sites-with-nginx-on-heroku</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have a few static sites on Heroku but in one case in particular I already had quite an involved nginx configuration &#8211; mainly 410s for some previous content and a series of redirects from older versions of the site. The common way of having static sites on Heroku appears to be to use a simple Rack middleware, but that would have meant reimplementing lots of boring redirect logic.</p>
<p>Heroku <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks">buildpacks</a> are great. The newer cedar stack is no longer tied to a particular language or framework, instead all of the discovery and knowledge about particular software is put into a buildpack. As well as the Heroku provided list it&#8217;s possible to write you&#8217;re own. Or in this case use one someone has <a href="https://github.com/essh/heroku-buildpack-nginx">created earlier</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just moved <a href="http://www.vagrantbox.es/">Vagrantbox.es</a> over to Heroku due to the closure of a previous service. In doing that, instead of the simple database backed app, I&#8217;ve simply thrown all the content onto <a href="https://github.com/garethr/vagrantboxes-heroku">GitHub</a>. This means anyone can fork the content and send pull requests. Hopefully this should mean I pay a bit more attention to suggestions and new boxes.</p>
<p>The repository is a nice simple example of using the mentioned Heroku Nginx buildpack too. You just run the following command to create a new Heroku application.</p>
<pre>heroku create --stack cedar --buildpack http://github.com/essh/heroku-buildpack-nginx.git</pre>
<p>And then in typical Heroku fashion use a git remote to deploy changes and updates. The repository is split into a <em>www</em> folder with the site content and a <em>conf</em> folder with the nginx configuration. The only clever parts involve the use of an <span class="caps">ERB</span> template for the nginx configuration file so we can pickup the correct port. We also use 1 worker process and don&#8217;t automatically daemonize the process &#8211; Heroku deals with this itself.</p>]]></content>

    <updated>2012-04-06T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.morethanseven.net/2012/04/06/Self-contained-jruby-web-applications</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Several things seemed to come together at once to make me want to hack on this particular project. In no particular order:</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/articles/technology-radar-march-2012">Thoughtworks Technology Radar</a> said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Embedding a servlet container, such as Jetty, inside a Java application has many advantages over running the application inside a container. Testing is relatively painless because of the simple startup, and the development environment is closer to production. Nasty surprises like mismatched versions of libraries or drivers are eliminated by not sharing across multiple applications. While you will have to manage and monitor multiple Java Virtual Machines in production using this model, we feel the advantages offered by the simplicity and isolation are significant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been getting more interested in JRuby anyway, partly because we&#8217;re finding ourselves using both Ruby and Scala at work, and maintaining a single target platform makes sense to me. Throw in the potential for interop between those languages and it&#8217;s certainly worth investigating.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.playframework.org/">Play 2.0</a> shipped and currently only provides the ability to create a self contained executable with bundled web server. Creating <span class="caps">WAR</span> files for more traditional application servers is on the roadmap but interestingly wasn&#8217;t deemed essential for the big 2.0 release. I had a nice chat with <a href="https://twitter.com/minglis">Martyn Inglis</a> at work about some of the nice side effects of this setup.</p>
<p>And throw in every time I have to configure straight Ruby applications for production environments I get cross. I know where all the bits and pieces are buried and can do it well, but with so many moving parts it&#8217;s absolutely no fun whatsoever.</p>
<p>Warbler, the JRuby tool for creating <span class="caps">WAR</span> files from Ruby source, has just added the ability to <a href="https://github.com/jruby/warbler/commit/0558a285eb59a0801cf7c0f274777b06b63883b3">embed Jetty to the master branch</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to take all of this for a quick spin, and the <a href="https://github.com/garethr/jruby-embedded-jetty">resulting code is up on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>This is the simplest Rack application possible, it just prints <em>Hello Jetty</em>. And the <span class="caps">README</span> covers how to install and run it so I won&#8217;t duplcate that information here.</p>
<p>But I will print some nearly meaningless and unscientific benchmarks because, hey, who doesn&#8217;t like those?</p>

<p>2736 requests per second on JRuby/Jetty vs 1600 on Ruby/Thin. As noted this isn&#8217;t meaningfully useful, in that it&#8217;s a hello world example and I&#8217;ve not tried to pick the fastest stacks on either side. I&#8217;m more bothered about it not being slower, because the main reason to pursue this approach is simplicity. Having a single self contained artefact that contains all it&#8217;s dependencies including a production web server is very appealing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping to give this a go with some less trivial applications, and probably more importantly look to compare a production stack based around these self-contained executables vs the dependency chain that is modern Ruby application stacks.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://blog.nicksieger.com/">Nick Sieger</a> for both writing Warbler and for helping with a few questions on the JRuby mailing list and on Twitter. Thanks also to <a href="https://twitter.com/jabley">James Abley</a> for a few pointers on Java system properties.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been pretty busy with all things <a href="https://www.gov.uk"><span class="caps">GOV</span>.UK</a> recently but I&#8217;ve managed to get a few bits of unrelated code up and a few talks in. I&#8217;m <em>still</em> pretty busy so here&#8217;s a list of some of them rather than a proper blog post.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/mining-puppet">Puppet Data Mining</a> talk from last weeks PuppetCamp in Edinburgh.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/web-operations">Introducting Web Operations</a> talk I gave at work to give my mainly non-development colleagues an idea about what it&#8217;s all about.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/learnings-from-govuk">Learning from building <span class="caps">GOV</span>.UK</a> talk I gave a month back or so to Cambridge Geek Night. We did an excellent full project retrospective after the beta launch and this lists some of the things we learnt.</li>
</ul>
<p>After someone bugged me on Twitter I realised the small bit of code we&#8217;ve been using for our Nagios dashboard wasn&#8217;t out in the wild. So introducing <a href="https://github.com/garethr/nash">Nash</a>, a very simple high level check dashboard which screenscrapes nagiosand runs happily on Heroku.</p>
<p>Although I&#8217;ve not been writing too much on here I&#8217;ve been keeping <a href="http://devopsweekly.com/">Devops Weekly</a> going each week for over a year now. I&#8217;ve just crossed 3000 subscribers which is pretty neat for a pet project.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a bit of a cheat blog post really. I&#8217;ve been crazy busy all month with little time for anything except work (specifically shipping the first release of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">www.gov.uk</a>). I have had a little time to blog over on the Cabinet Office blog though, about work we&#8217;ve done with dashboards.</p>
<p><a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/02/08/radiating-information/">http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/02/08/radiating-information/</a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re ever looking for good little hack projects dashboards are perfect, and often hugely useful once up and running. Convincing people of this before you have a few in the office might be hard &#8211; so just build something simple in a lunch break and find a screen to put it on. We&#8217;ve had great feedback from ours, both from people wandering through the office and from our colleagues who have a better idea of what&#8217;s going on.</p>]]></content>

    <updated>2012-01-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.morethanseven.net/2012/01/06/Talking-to-jenkins-from-campfire-with-hubot</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In what turned out to be a productive holiday hacking with languages I&#8217;d not used before, I got round to writing some coffeescript on node.js. This was more to do with scratching a personal itch that pure experimentation. I had a play with <a href="https://github.com/github/janky">Janky</a> (Github&#8217;s Jenkins/Hubot mashup) but found it a little opinionated on the Jenkins side, but the campfire integration is excellent. Looking at the Jenkins commands in <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/">hubot-scripts</a> though I found those even more opinionated.</p>
<p>The magic of open source though is you can just fix things, then ask nice people if they like what you&#8217;ve done. I set about writing a few more general commands and lo, the&#8217;ve been quickly <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/pull/23840h">merged upstream</a>.</p>
<p>These add:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A command to list all your Jenkins jobs and the current state</li>
	<li>A command to trigger a normal build</li>
	<li>A command to trigger a build with a list of parameters</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRipwAIM" alt="campfire window showing jenkins tasks"/></p>
<p>This was made much easier by first looking at the previous Jenkins commands, and then looking at other scripts in the hubot-scripts repository. The best way of learning a new language/framework is still on the shoulders of others.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a few other good ideas for Jenkins related commands. I want to add a filter command to the jobs list, both by name and by current state. For longer running jobs I also want to report whether a build is currently running. And then maybe get information about a specific job, like the last few runs or similar. Any other requests or ideas most welcome.</p>]]></content>

    <link href="http://www.morethanseven.net/2011/12/31/Ec2-tasks-for-fabric/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.morethanseven.net/2011/12/31/Ec2-tasks-for-fabric</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For running ad-hoc commands across a small number of servers you really can&#8217;t beat <a href="http://fabfile.org">Fabric</a>. It requires nothing other than ssh installed on the servers, is generally just a one-line install and requires next to no syntaxtic fluff between you and the commands you want running. It&#8217;s much more of a swiss army knife to Capistranos bread knife.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found myself doing more and more EC2 work of late and have finally gotten around to making my life easier when using Fabric with Amazon instances. The result of a bit of hacking is <a href="https://github.com/garethr/cloth">Cloth</a> (also <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cloth">available on PyPi</a>). It contains some utility functions and a few handy tasks for loading host details from the EC2 <span class="caps">API</span> and using them in your Fabric tasks. No more static lists of host names that constantly need updating in your fabfile.</p>
<p>Specifically, with a fabfile that looks like:</p>
<pre>#! /usr/bin/env python
from cloth.tasks import *</pre>
<p>You can run:</p>
<pre>fab all list</pre>
<p>And get something like:</p>
<pre>instance-name-1 (xx.xxx.xxx.xx, xxx.xx.xx.xx)
instance-name-2 (xx.xxx.xxx.xx, xxx.xx.xx.xx)
instance-name-3 (xx.xxx.xxx.xx, xxx.xx.xx.xx)
instance-name-4 (xx.xxx.xxx.xx, xxx.xx.xx.xx)
instance-name-5 (xx.xxx.xxx.xx, xxx.xx.xx.xx)
instance-name-6 (xx.xxx.xxx.xx, xxx.xx.xx.xx)
instance-name-7 (xx.xxx.xxx.xx, xxx.xx.xx.xx)
instance-name-8 (xx.xxx.xxx.xx, xxx.xx.xx.xx)
...</pre>
<p>And then you could run:</p>
<pre>fab -P all uptime</pre>
<p>And you&#8217;d happily get the load averages and uptime for all your EC2 instances.</p>
<p>A few more tricks are documented in the <a href="https://github.com/garethr/cloth">GitHub <span class="caps">README</span></a>, including filtering the list by a regex and some convention based mapping to Fabric roles. I&#8217;ll hopefully add a few more features as I need them and generally tidy up a few things but I&#8217;m pretty happy with it so far.</p>]]></content>

    <link href="http://www.morethanseven.net/2011/12/26/First-experience-building-something-with-clojure/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.morethanseven.net/2011/12/26/First-experience-building-something-with-clojure</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I nearly always try and grab some time over Christmas to try something new and this year I&#8217;d been planning on spending some time with Clojure. I have several friends who are big fans, but dipping in and out of a book hadn&#8217;t really worked. What I needed was an itch to scratch.</p>
<p>I stuck with a domain I&#8217;m pretty familiar with for this first project, namely building a little web application. It renders a web page, makes <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests, parses <span class="caps">JSON</span> into native data structures and does a bit of data juggling. Nothing fancy or overly ambitious, I was mainly interested in picking up the syntax, understanding common libraries and getting something built. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve got:</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRjBuAIM" alt="Dasboard for Jenkins builds"/></p>
<p>Jenkins has various <span class="caps">API</span> endpoints, but most dashboards I&#8217;ve seen concentrate on showing you the current status of all the builds. This is hugely useful when it comes to the simple case of continuous integration, but I&#8217;ve also been using Jenkins for other automation tasks, and making extensive use of parameterized builds. What the dashboard above concentrates on is showing recent builds for a specific job, along with the parameters used to run them.</p>
<p>Overall it was a fun project. Clojure made much more sense to me building this application than it had from simple examples. The <a href="http://webnoir.org/">Noir</a> web framework is excellent and proved easy enough to jump into and simple enough that I could read the source code if I was interested in how something worked. The <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">Leiningen</a> build tool made getting started, downloading and managing dependencies and running tests and the application itself easy.</p>
<p>What I didn&#8217;t find particularly appealing was the lack of a strong standard library coupled with the difficulty of tracking down suitable libraries. <span class="caps">JSON</span> parsing, dealing with <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests and date handing are very common activities in web programming and all needed me to jump around looking at the best way of dealing with the common case. I settled on <a href="https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http">clj-http</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dakrone/cheshire">chesire</a> and using Java interop for date formatting. clj-http suffered from having lots of forks on GitHub to navigate through. I started with clojure-json before discovering it had been deprecated. And neither clj-time or date-clj appeared to support unix timestamps as far as I could tell from the source. Throw in some uncertainty over the status of clojure-contrib that isn&#8217;t well documented on the official site and it needs some effort to get started.</p>
<p>The working code for this is already up on <a href="https://github.com/garethr/jenkins-build-list">GitHub</a> and I&#8217;d be interested in any Clojure experts showing me the error of my ways.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not sure how novel this approach is but a few folks at work hadn&#8217;t seen it before so I thought it worth jotting down.</p>
<p>If you have even a small but dynamic set of servers then a problem arises with how those nodes are defined in puppet. A node remember is defined in puppet like so:</p>
<pre>node web3.example.com {
  include web_server
}</pre>
<p>The problem is twofold. If you have a growing infrastructure, that list of nodes is going to get quickly out of hand. The other problem is around provisioning new hosts, the obvious approach to which is something like:</p>
<p>1. Summon new EC2 instance<br />
2. Change the node definition to include the new hostname<br />
3. Install puppet on instance and so the ssl certificate signing dance<br />
4. Run puppet</p>
<p>Step 2 stands out. The others are easily automated, but do you want to automate a change to your puppet manifests and a redeploy to the puppetmaster for a new instance? Probably not.<br />
Puppet has the concept of an external node classifier which can be used to solve this problem, but another simpler approach is to use an environment variable on the new machine.</p>
<p>Lets say we define our nodes something like this instead:</p>
<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>node default {
</span><span class='line'>  case $machine_role {
</span><span class='line'>    frontend:           { include web_server }
</span><span class='line'>    backend:            { include app_server }
</span><span class='line'>    data:               { include db_server }
</span><span class='line'>    monitoring:         { include monitoring_server }
</span><span class='line'>    development:        { include development }
</span><span class='line'>    default:            { include base }
</span><span class='line'>  }
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div></notextile></p>
<p>If a machine runs and sets the $machine_role variable to frontend it includes the web_server class, if that variable equals &#8216;data&#8217; it&#8217;s going to include the db_server class instead. Much cleaner and more maintainable in my view. Now to set that variable.</p>
<p>Facter is the tool used by Puppet to get system information like the operating system or processor count. You can use these facter provided variables anywhere in your manifests. And one way of adding a new fact is via an environment variable on the client. Any environment variable prefixed with FACTER_ will be available in Puppet manifests. So in this case we can:</p>
<pre>export FACTER_machine_role=frontend</pre>
<p>So our steps from above become something like:</p>
<p>1. Summon new machine<br />
2. echo &#8220;export FACTER_machine_role=backend&#8221; &gt;&gt; /etc/environment<br />
3. Install puppet on instance and so the ssl certificate signing dance<br />
4. Run puppet</p>
<p>Much easier to automate. And if you&#8217;re looking at a box and want to know what it&#8217;s role is you can check the relevant environment variable.</p>]]></content>
