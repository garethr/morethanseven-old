    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I did a quick lightning talk at the Refresh Cambridge meetup last night, a very quick introduction to "Varnish":https://www.varnish-cache.org/. Given 10 minutes all I really wanted to do was get people to go away and take a look at it. Lots of folks in the room hadn't come across it before so I think the talk was hopefully well pitched.</p>

<p>Several people asked about slighly dynamic pages and I only got chance to mention support for "ESI":https://www.varnish-cache.org/trac/wiki/ESIfeatures (Edge Side Includes) at the end. Conversation afterwards turned to various parts of the modern web stack and I had a pretty good time being opinionated. Hopefully more of the same next month.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night was the first Cambridge Geek Night and saw 35 people or so fill a room above a pub to listen to a few short talks and converse with fellow geeks. I had the pleasure of giving the first talk, a short introduction to using message queues for web developers.</p>

<object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=messagequeues-090611064000-phpapp01&stripped_title=message-queues-for-web-applications" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=messagequeues-090611064000-phpapp01&stripped_title=message-queues-for-web-applications" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object>


<p>I got lots of good questions from interested people and by the sounds of things it had the desired effect - for people unfamiliar with using a message queue to go out and have a play with some of the cool software available to solve your problems.</p>

<p>Overall the night was definitely a success. Suitably geeky conversations. A chance to meet new people as well as old friends. Good job "Vero":http://www.thatcanadiangirl.co.uk/ and "David":http://blog.fatbusinessman.com/ for organising the event and here's to the next one.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I gave a short presentation about App Engine last night at the "Cambridge Python User Group":http://campug.org.uk/ and as always it's available on "Slideshare":http://slideshare.net.</p>

<object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=appengine-090304031400-phpapp02&stripped_title=app-engine-for-python-developers" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=appengine-090304031400-phpapp02&stripped_title=app-engine-for-python-developers" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object>


<p>I find App Engine a great way of just writing (Python) code and putting it online quickly, and the presentation was aimed at being something of a fanboy ode. During questions afterwards we talked about some of the limitations and cases where App Engine isn't as well suited, and at least a few people were heading off planning on having a play.</p>

<p>The event was good fun and I picked up a few Python related tips and tricks from the other presentations and general conversation. Thanks for everyone who organised and attended the event and to "RealVNC":http://www.realvnc.com/ for hosting the talks.</p>
