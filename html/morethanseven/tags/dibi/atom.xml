<p>The videos from the "DIBI":http://www.dibiconference.com/ conference are now up on "Vimeo":http://vimeo.com/groups/48480/videos. Lots of good stuff and more to come. The one disadvantage of a a two track conference is you miss half the talks so when I get a chance I'll be catching up with those talks I didn't get chance to see.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm just getting back from Newcastle after getting to present at the first Design It Build It conference. It was great to be back up in Newcastle and to see lots of familiar faces. As with most conferences it was also good to meet new people (especially those for whom it was their first conference) and to listen to people talking about interesting stuff. Personal highlights for me were David Singleton from Last.fm and Michael Brunton Spall from The Guardian going through really interesting case studies from their respective organisations. It's the sort of gritty content it's often hard to come by. Speaking did mean I missed out on most of the design track unfrotunately, but videos should be available soon and by all accounts it sounds like the larger designer crowd went home happy.</p>

<p>I think my presentation at "DIBI":http://dibiconference.co.uk went OK. I'd got a little bit carried away with cramming content in, which meant it felt rushed at times and I still went over by 5 minutes into my Q&amp;A time. But hey, a few people said nice things afterwards.</p>

<p>I wanted to tell the world (of web developers) about as many different tools as I could. I think most people who read this blog have probably come across most of this software, heck you might be commiting code to it or already using it in production. But lots of people haven't ever heard of Memcached, never mind Cassandra or RabbitMQ. And more inportant than the specific software is the differnt types of tools available. Small web servers, message queues, HTTP caches, etc. Conferences are a good place to find and educate people. Hopefully I managed to do just that.</p>

<p>One thing I hope I got across, I'm not for a moment saying you shouldn't be using tools you know and love. Nor am I saying you should jump in and start using lots of crazy software. But keeping an eye on new developments can serve you well when it comes to deciding whether the best approach is really to build something from scratch. I've spoken to several people over the last few weeks who where starting to write simple queing systems using cron and mysql, or using a hand rolled file system based caching setup. And in both cases I think they would be better served by existing tools.</p>

<p>My slides had <em>a lot</em> of links in them and I mentioned during my talk I'm put a list of them somewhere:</p>

    <link href="http://www.morethanseven.net/2010/01/07/speaking-dibi/"/>
    <updated>2010-01-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.morethanseven.net/2010/01/07/speaking-dibi</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'll be heading back up to Newcastle in April to give a talk at what's shaping up to be a good looking conference to kick off the year with. "DIBI":http://www.whatisdibi.com/ is trying to please everyone, with both front and backend focused streams.</p>

<p>bq. Created for both sides of the web coin, DIBI brings together designers and developers for an unusual two-track web conference. World renowned speakers leading in their fields of work will talk about all things web. Taking place in Newcastle upon Tyne, (it's oop north) at The Sage Gateshead on the 28th April 2010, we're bringing both sides of the web world together with some awesome speakers.</p>

<p>I'm not a big fan of making a point of dividing frontend and backend work. You nearly always end up with javascript dominated horribleness (because we only had a front end person available) or a so called content management system that means all sites have to look the same except for the colour palette. So I'm hoping lots of cross over stuff happens and interesting conversations abound.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you're wondering what I'll be speaking about it's probably going to be something about all the cool tools you could and should be using when building or looking after web applications. I'll probably be doing my best to convince people to look outside the comfort of the LAMP or C#/MSSQL stacks and realise the future for lots of web developers might just be more devops.</p>
