    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Looks like I'm being experimented on. I just got a strange <em>Web</em> button appearing on a search today and decided to click it. It revealed a host of new Google features (at least I've never seen em before), including various filters and visualisation tools.</p>

<p>The entertainingly named Wonder Wheel was my first click. It's a visualisation which shows related search terms. I'd love to have access to that data via an API as well.</p>

<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRiJJww" alt="Example of Wonder Wheel search on Google"/></p>

<p>The timeline view, and time based filters, look more useful for most search activities. Just getting hold of recent content on a particular search term is the sort of thing blog search engines have sended to do well in the past and that Twitter search has been showing off.</p>

<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRiiHww" /></p>

<p>I hope I keep these features during whatever testing is going on and that they all go live soon. It's a pretty big improvement if you ask me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm starting to play around with using "App Engine":http://code.google.com/appengine/ again for small projects. It's great for simple, somewhat throwaway apps as long as you don't need anything too fancy. Actually all I want really is long running processes but I digress.</p>

<p>I'm increasingly writing test suites as well for even small projects and was missing the convenience of the Django test runner for running them against App Engine code. So I've spent a little time writing a simple test running script to use for non-Django Python projects. I've posted it over on the "App Engine Cookbook":http://appengine-cookbook.appspot.com/recipe/app-engine-test-runner/ for anyone else who might want to do the same.</p>

<p>I ended up writing something myself as I couldn't find anything else which quite met my needs, so it's the typical programmers itch code and as such is provided as <em>works for me</em> software. The other approaches out their didn't quite meet my needs but might be useful to know about if you want to start testing your apps.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Nose GAE":http://code.google.com/p/nose-gae/ uses the nose testing framework which I'm less familiar with.</li>
<li>"GAE Unit":http://code.google.com/p/gaeunit/ uses PyUnit but presents it's results in a browser rather than on the command line.</li>
</ul>
