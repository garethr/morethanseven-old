    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of several little projects I have up and running on "GitHub":http://github.com at present is "LocalBuilder":http://github.com/garethr/localbuilder/tree/master. It's a pretty simple little script which watches for changes in a given directory and when they occur runs a given command. I knocked it together to use to trigger the running of a test suite each time I save files in a project. It's written in Python but you could use it to run commands in any language you like.</p>

<p>It's all pretty simple Python really and is hopefully reasonably commented and tested so if you're interested you can follow along with "the code":http://github.com/garethr/localbuilder/tree/master. If you just want to use the damn thing then:</p>

<pre><code>./localbuilder --path /path/to/watch --command /command/to/execute</code></pre>


<p>It turns out Ruby has a much nicer tool to do this and more in autotest, part of the "ZenTest":http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/ suite of testing tools. I'm finding more and more very nice bits of code written in Ruby of late, but that's probably a whole different blog post.</p>
