    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My latest <em>on a train</em> project is "Dumper":http://github.com/garethr/Dumper, a static generator for web services. I'm a huge fan of "Nanoc":http://nanoc.stoneship.org/ and tools like "Jekyl":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyl for building websites. But I spend at least as much time building small webservicds. I wanted something super simple that would let me expose data I had access to as a read only web service.</p>

<p>At the moment that means using a mysql database, specifying a SQL query and running a python script. Hey presto you have lots and lots of XML and JSON files representing your data. Dumper provides hooks for you to customise the ourput or even overide the database layer. It should be possible if you were so inclined to replace the mysql backend with another database, or other type of data store. Hopefully some of these might end up in my branch at a later date.</p>

<p>At a basic level all you need is a config file which looks a little like:</p>

<p><notextile>
&lt;% syntax_colorize :ini, type=:coderay do %>
[Dumper]
path: people
index: id
backend: mysql</p>

<p>[Database]
sql: SELECT id, name FROM people
host: localhost
username: root
password:
database: dumper
&lt;% end %>
</notextile></p>

<p>And then run a command line application against that file:</p>

<p><notextile>
&lt;% syntax_colorize :bash, type=:coderay do %>
dumper -c people.ini dump
&lt;% end %>
</notextile></p>

<p>The application supports a number of flags for specifying where you want the files to be generated, what your config file is called and to clean up any generated files if you want to try again. The output will let you know which files have been updated, which deleted and which added too. If you'd rather have a single file but with all your records in then that's easy too - just add something to the config file.</p>

<p>It's somewhat early days for Dumper, and I've not seen anything similar so their are definately some rough edges that could do with some work. All of that will really come down to how much use it gets. I'd appreciate any feedback from anyone with a similar itch to scratch too.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's taken longer than I would have liked but I've finally gotten around to relaunching this site on "nanoc":http://nanoc.stoneship.org/.</p>

<p>After looking through lots of code from the "nanoc showcase":http://projects.stoneship.org/trac/nanoc/wiki/Showcase I had a pretty good feel for how I wanted things to work and I then used the excellent "nanoc3_blog":http://github.com/mgutz/nanoc3_blog template to get started. I've hacked around quite a bit with the code to get things how I wanted them. Using "Less":http://lesscss.org/ to make the CSS more manageable, "Coderay":http://coderay.rubychan.de/ for lovely syntax highlighting and making everything default to textile rather than markdown. I've also written import scripts for my old blog (in Python) and another one so I can use tumblr is I want to create items on here (in Ruby).</p>

<p>Nanoc really is a joy to work with and I'm hoping that alone will get me back into writing more freqently than I have done for a while. The fact I can just write in Vim or WriteRoom or whatever editor I have to hand feels nice. And using Git, Rake and Rsync complete my little toolset. Everything is still served via Nginx.</p>

<p>I've thrown the all the code, including all the content, up on "GitHub":http://github.com/garethr/morethanseven for anyone interested. Back to writing.</p>
