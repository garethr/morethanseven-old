    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had fun speaking at "QCon":http://qconlondon.com/ in London earlier this month with a talk on the Cloud track entitled the Perils of Portability.</p>

<p>This had some Governmenty stuff in but was mainly part rant, part hope for the future of cloud infrastructure. I had some great conversations with people afterwards who felt some of the similar pain which was nice to know. I also somehow managed to get 120 slides into a 40 minute presentation which I think is a personal records.</p>
