    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Looks like I'm being experimented on. I just got a strange <em>Web</em> button appearing on a search today and decided to click it. It revealed a host of new Google features (at least I've never seen em before), including various filters and visualisation tools.</p>

<p>The entertainingly named Wonder Wheel was my first click. It's a visualisation which shows related search terms. I'd love to have access to that data via an API as well.</p>

<p>The timeline view, and time based filters, look more useful for most search activities. Just getting hold of recent content on a particular search term is the sort of thing blog search engines have sended to do well in the past and that Twitter search has been showing off.</p>

<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRiiHww" /></p>

<p>I hope I keep these features during whatever testing is going on and that they all go live soon. It's a pretty big improvement if you ask me.</p>
