    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The following is the email I sent to lots of my colleagues at the
<a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">Government Digital Service</a> last week.</em></p>

<p>So, after 3 rather exciting years I've decided to leave GDS.</p>

<p>That's surprisingly difficult to write if I'm honest.</p>

<p>I was part of the team that built and shipped the beta of <a href="https://www.gov.uk">GOV.UK</a>.
Since then I've worked across half of what has become GDS, equally
helping and frustrating (then hopefully helping) lots of you. I've
done a great deal and learnt even more, as well as collected arcane
knowledge about government infosec and the dark arts of procurement
along the way. I've done, and helped others do, work I wouldn't even
have thought possible (or maybe likely is the right word?) when I
started.</p>

<p>So why leave? For all the other things I do I'm basically a tool
builder. So I'm going off to work for <a href="http://puppetlabs.com">Puppet Labs</a> to build
infrastructure tools that don't suck. That sort of pretty specific
work is something that <em>should</em> be done outside government in my
opinion. I'm a pretty firm believer in "government should only do what
only government can do" (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles#second">design principle number 2</a> for those that
haven't memorised them yet). And if I'm honest, focusing on something
smaller than fixing a country's civic infrastructure is appealing for
now.</p>

<p>I'll let you in on a secret; I didn't join what became GDS because of
the GOV.UK project. I joined to work with friends I'd not yet had the
chance to work with and to see the inside of a growing organisation
from the start. I remember <a href="http://twitter.com/tomskitomski">Tom Loosemore</a> promising me we'd be 200
people in 3 years! As far as anyone knows we're 650+ people. That's
about a person a day for 2 years. I'm absolutely not saying that came
without a cost, but for me being part of that that was part of the
point - so I can be a little accepting with hindsight.</p>

<p>For me, apart from all the short term things (side-note: this job now
has me thinking Â£10million is a small amount of money and 2 years is a
small amount of time) there is one big mission:</p>

<blockquote><p>Make government a sustainable part of the UK tech community</p></blockquote>

<p>That means in 10 years time experienced tech people from across the
country, as well as people straight from university, choosing to work
for government. Not just for some abstract and personal reason (though
that's fine too), but because it's a a genuinely interesting place to
work. That one's on us.</p>
