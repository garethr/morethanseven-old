<p>email2rss is one of my php projects. The aim is to allow simple access to rss feeds from any email client. Ideally suited to mobile devices without a reader or to less technical users.</p>

It makes use of the lastRSS library to read external rss feeds and output the details, as well as a few tricks to read in an email (from stdin) sent to its own address and to email back the user with the news requested in the subject line.
