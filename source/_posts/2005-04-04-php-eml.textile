<p>php-eml is a sourceforge open source project I started a while back to develop a php based email mailing list. At the moment this in at a stage where it works but is not really pretty or easy to install unless you enjoy a little sysadmin.</p>


 <pre><code>Both these, and some new features should be added in the future, time permitting.</code></pre>
