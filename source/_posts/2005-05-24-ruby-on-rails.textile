<p>After much going backwards and forwards I finally sat down and had a protracted play with Ruby on Rails and so far I have to say I&#8217;m impressed.</p>


 <p>Installation was simple enought and I got it running on both mac and linux hardware pretty easily, always a bonus, and I have vim set up to play with ERuby syntax.</p>


 <p>I had dabbled previously with Ruby and coming from PHP the syntax is fairly self explanatory (remember end not }).But ActiveRecord in particular seems just great.</p>


 <p>I&#8217;m going through the Four days on Rails tutorials at the moment so should have something more insightful to say in a week or so (I dont actually have four days in a row to just do this really).</p>
