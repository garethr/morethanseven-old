title: "Th_nking about a move"

<p>Sorry for the title. As a few people already know I&#8217;m moving jobs at the end of the month to Th_nk. Basically to do more web design with the emphasis on XHTML, CSS and the like.</p>


 <p>I&#8217;m not going to go on about it as I&#8217;m trying to stick to issues on here about web stuff rather than about me but thought it worth a post.</p>
