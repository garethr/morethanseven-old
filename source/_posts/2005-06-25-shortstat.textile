title: "ShortStat"

<p>I&#8217;ve just install the ShortStat package from <a href="http://www.shauninman.com">www.shauninman.com</a>   and the Mac OS X widget from <a href="http://www.keeganjones.com/widgets/shortstat/">www.keeganjones.com/widgets/shortstat/</a> to go along with it. My desktop now tells me how few people are visiting my site!</p>


 <p>It&#8217;s the first really useful widget I can see myself using for more than pure eye candy.</p>


 <p>And ShortStat itself seems to be a very nice addition. Simple to set up and the output is nice and clear.</p>


 <p>To both the people visiting the site &#8211; dont worry I wont use your browsing habits for anything other than improving the site!</p>
