<p>I now have an ASP.NET environment setup and ready to go and the will to use it. Depending on how it goes I&#8217;ll try and post any thoughts as I go. In particularly related to how I get on with good standards markup.</p>


 <p>I can knock together whatever I want in PHP reasonably well and with my new job focusing on CSS and XHTML amongst other related bits, and working at .NET shop I thought I now have a reason to play.</p>
