title: "Design in Flight Magazine"

<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> Visiting the website I now find out that after the next mini issue it&#8217;s all over for Design in Flight. I can see how it could take over someone&#8217;s life considering the quality but I for one would have paid more to keep it around.</p>


 <p>I&#8217;ve just got round to buying all the back issues of Design in Flight (<a href="http://www.designinflight.com">www.designinflight.com</a>) magazine &#8211; which features articles on design, web development and similar fields.</p>


 <p>For only 10 dollars (via Pay Pal) for the 4 issues it seems excellent value at about 150 pages or so, brimming with interesting information.</p>


 <p>I&#8217;ve obviously not read that much as yet but so far so good and for the price you cant really go wrong.</p>
