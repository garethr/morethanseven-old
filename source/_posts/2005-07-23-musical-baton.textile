<p>For those like me behind the times, I was quite impressed to get passed the batton (thanks <a href="http://www.xlab.co.uk">phil</a>)</p>


 <p><strong>Total volume of music on my computer</strong>
    19.51Gb
<strong>Last CD I bought</strong>
    Foo Fighters &#8211; In Your Honor
<strong>Song playing right now?</strong>
    Well the last song I listened to was The English Motorway System by Black Box Recorder</p>


 <p><strong>5 songs that I listen to a lot or mean something to me?</strong></p>


 <ol>
 <li>Ash &#8211; Dancing on the Moon, Jesus Says B-side</li>
  <li>Johnny Cash &#8211; Hurt</li>
  <li>Easyworld &#8211; Goodnight</li>
  <li>Jimmy Eat World &#8211; The World You Love</li>
  <li>R.E.M. Strange Currencies</li>
 </ol>


 <p>Note that that list probably changes every day but hey, that&#8217;s for today. I quite like <a href="http://www.collylogic.com/index.php?/weblog/comments/music_monthlies_july_2005/">Simon&#8217;s</a> music monthlies idea but dont know whether I could ever really get round to it. Oh well.</p>
