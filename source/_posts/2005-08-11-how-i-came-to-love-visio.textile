title: "How i came to love visio"
---

<p>I&#8217;m doing a lot more IA stuff of late and being in a Microsoft shop that meant getting to play with Visio. And I have to say it&#8217;s a great tool. It&#8217;s pretty simple to pick up, powerful, lots of options and customisations and even better &#8211; simple to get to grips with.</p>


 <p>Quite a bit of work I&#8217;ve been doing has been around process and specification. I&#8217;d read The Elements of User Experience a while back but have been getting more into it recently, and the visual vocabulary stuff is excellent. Have a look on <a href="http://www.jjg.net/ia/visvocab/">www.jjg.net/ia/visvocab/</a> if your into this kind of planning. You can download Visio Shapes as well and then it&#8217;s just a matter of dragging, dropping and drawing arrows.</p>


 <p>Another good resourse has been <a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com">boxesandarrows.com</a>,  a site I&#8217;ve read on occasion but found both more useful and more time to read recently. Documentation seems pretty key to getting projects working efficiently within team environments &#8211; and pictures say a thousand words (or something).</p>
