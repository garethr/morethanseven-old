<p>I&#8217;ve been a (distant) admirer of <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> since I had a brief play a while back. Nice interface, good idea and all that. Well I finally got round to setting up a proper account.</p>


 <p>I&#8217;d recently got myself a reasonable digital camera. Nothing expensive or fancy &#8211; in the past whenever I&#8217;ve thought about taking photo&#8217;s I&#8217;ve always got bored and given up. This time is going to be different. Hopefully.</p>


 <p>I&#8217;ve only really got round to one proper shoot and in non ideal conditions (well, in terms of photography &#8211; basically in a room under a pub) but I&#8217;m pretty happy with a couple of the photo&#8217;s. But maybe that&#8217;s because I like somewhat abstract orange/red shots?</p>


 <p>Anyway, hopefully I&#8217;ll get round to taking and uploading some more shots. And maybe using some of them on this site.</p>
