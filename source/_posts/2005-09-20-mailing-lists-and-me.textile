<p>Ok. I just came to a realisation. I think somewhere along the line I got addicted. First I tried one. It seemed pretty good. Not really having any effect on my and generally just being good to feel part of something.</p>


 <p>But I couldn&#8217;t stop at one. I thought I could handle more and more. So I went in for some of the hard stuff. And lots of it.</p>


 <p>And look at me now. Typing this while waiting for more email that is reasonable for a small company in a week to download because I didn&#8217;t check my email for a day or so. Time for rehab I think.</p>


 <p>I dont want to chuck the habit completely, just pair back my addiction, get some control. So who stays and who goes?</p>


 <p>DiH (designersinhouse.com) is certainly leading at the moment as a keeper. It&#8217;s proved useful, interesting and informative so far &#8211; plus I met Matt at @media.</p>


 <p>I think maybe their&#8217;s room for one more. CSS-d, WSG, thelist, webdesign-L your time is coming.</p>
