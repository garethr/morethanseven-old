title: "Another great looking magazine"
---

<p>After <a href="http://andybudd.com">complains</a> of the lack of a decent magazine, and after the passing and resurection of Design in Flight another one raised it&#8217;s head. Yeh. Have a look at <a href="http://particletree.com/treehouse/">treehouse</a>.</p>


 <p>Another great, low cost ($15), well designed publication that you can print out and read in the moments away from the computer.</p>


 <p>OK, so I haven&#8217;t read that much yet but what I have was both interesting, informative and hey, pretty well edited.</p>


 <p>Thumbs up to any and all involved.</p>
