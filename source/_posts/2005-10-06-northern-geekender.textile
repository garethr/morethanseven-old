<p>Peter J Lambert of <a href="http://pixelicious.co.uk/">Pixelicious</a> fame has had a great idea. At least the best idea I heard today. Pretty short notice but if anyone fancies a trip down (or up?) to York for something of a geek get together let me know.</p>


 <p>I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m definately going as I just found out but decided to spread the word anyway &#8211; and with any luck will definately try and make the trip. I had been feeling (and I think I even complained once) about the lack of a sense of Northerness (not that southerners, or Scots for that matter, aren&#8217;t nice people or anything but&#8230;) amongst web design. Real Ale, Grit, Coal, that sort of thing &#8211; you just dont see that much web design that looks like it was inspired by that.</p>


 <p>Anyway, the 15th (Saturday) looks to be the date of choice. Head over to <a href="http://pixelicious.co.uk/">pixelicious.co.uk</a> to express an interest or complain or find out more information.</p>


 <p>If anyone from around Newcastle does fancy it let me know as well &#8211; I&#8217;d probably be even more inclined to go and meet strangers if other strangers (or <a href="http://randomcat.co.uk">Chris</a>) who live and work near me where going.</p>
