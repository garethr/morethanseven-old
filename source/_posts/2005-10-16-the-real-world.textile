title: "The Real World"
---

<p>All of a sudden it&#8217;s all about the real world. In fact that&#8217;s my prediction for 2006 &#8211; geeks moving out into real social activities (often involving beer) around blogs and mailing lists what not. Anyway&#8230;</p>


 <p>After the Northern Geekender yesterday, which was a really good do for all those that couldn&#8217;t make it, I found out about another meet up even closer to home &#8211; in Newcastle no less.</p>


 <p>So people over at the <a href="http://www.accessify.com">Accessify</a> forum are organising a <a href="http://www.accessifyforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=28544#28544">get together</a>  on the 27th of this month. Things are coming fast and furious at the moment. I&#8217;ll hopefully be going along, although it starts at 5:30 and I finish work at 6:00 so might be a bit late.</p>


 <p>I&#8217;ll post more details about that as I get anything, and I&#8217;ll post any half decent photos (and link to the inevitable <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> group) as stuff happens.</p>
