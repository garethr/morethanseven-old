<p>The real <a href="http://www.cssreboot.com">CSS Reboot</a> should be going off anytime now. But I&#8217;m in Rome (this message is coming at you through the magic of Textpatterns publish on date facility) so had to put things up a <em>little</em> prematurely. Oh well. In fairness I know which one I&#8217;d prefer to be doing.</p>


 <p>I&#8217;ll miss the initial rush of running through lots of screen shots and sites, finding new things and generally wanting to redo the design at least for a week anyway. When I&#8217;m back I&#8217;ll post a list of one&#8217;s that caught my eye.</p>


 <p>In the meantime a couple of other ongoing bits. I&#8217;ll try and sort out lots of photos onto Flickr when I&#8217;m back, hopefully including some shots from Rome and a few other series I&#8217;ve taken and not got round to. Also after meetups, lots of discussion on and around <a href="http://newcastlenewmedia.org">newcastlenewmedia.org</a> hopefully a sense of renewed focus and some hapenings around that.</p>


 <p>All in all I&#8217;m sure I wont be missed, but enjoy the reboot. If you have any personal favourites then leave a comment. If you have opinions about mine then leave those too. Especially if they&#8217;re nice.</p>
