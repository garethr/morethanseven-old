<p>Right. I wasn&#8217;t at <a href="http://www.dconstruct.org">d.Construct</a> I&#8217;m still a bit gutted really as it sounded like a hoot and lots of it was up my street and would have been good to meet up with &#8216;people&#8217;. But hey, I can still watch the feeds pour in right?</p>


 <p>With that in mind, to again make my life easier and hopefully be of some use I&#8217;ve set up another (the first one was for <a href="http://www.atmedia2005.co.uk">@media</a>) feed syndicator.</p>

 <p>All I&#8217;m doing is parsing, storing and displaying all the feeds. On first run I picked up 27 and hopefully by the time you read this more will have been said. The collection of feeds are a combination of people I&#8217;ve met and people who where blogging about @media. If you have a feed and want it adding just leave a comment on here or drop me an <a href="mailto:gareth@morethanseven.net">email</a> and I&#8217;ll add it to the rest.</p>


 <p>I&#8217;ll just say a big shout for everyone at <a href="http://www.clearleft.com">Clearleft</a> for organising it on such short notice. I&#8217;d rather thinks like this happen and me not be there than they not happen at all because of problems with size or cost or admin. Maybe next year?</p>
