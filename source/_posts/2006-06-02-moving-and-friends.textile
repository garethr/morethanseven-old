<p>I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll have to bare with me at the moment. I&#8217;m busy, moving house, have no internet outside work (except open wi-fi points) and oh, did I mention I&#8217;m busy?</p>


 <p>I have the usual raft of ideas, inability to really finish things unless I try and a dangerous penchant for playing with ever more scripting languages (<a href="http://media.wu-wien.ac.at/">XOTcl</a> anyone?).</p>


 <p>Oh, the friends bit? Inspired by <a href="http://molly.com">Molly</a> and her incredible ability to be open about her life, I thought I&#8217;d say a huge <strong>Thank you</strong> to everyone who helped me move house this week. Much appreciated. It could have gone oh so wrong, but everyone chipping in meant everything worked out just fine.</p>
