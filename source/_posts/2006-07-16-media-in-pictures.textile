<p>I always take ages to get photos off my camera. It&#8217;s like the sort of delay you would get if you sent them off to be developed. Anyhow, I&#8217;ve finally sorted out my <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a> photos and uploaded a few to flickr. Have a look if you feel so inclined. I&#8217;ve included a few below, mainly because these ones made me chuckle:</p>


 <p>A look of sheer horror if ever their was one from <a href="http://splintered.co.uk">Patrick</a>.</p>

 <p>Is &#8220;Chris Wilson&#8221;: not the spitting image of He Man?</p>

 <p>If this isn&#8217;t caption competition material I dont know what is. <a href="http://cackhanded.net">Norm</a> was most definately <em>the man</em> that night.</p>

 <p>Ah. The famous straw incident. Featuring <a href="http://theintranetblog.blogspot.com/">Nic</a> and an awful lot of straws.</p>

 <p>And I&#8217;m still trying to decide what was funnier; the fact <a href="http://htmldog.com">Patrick</a> set up a bird bath in the middle of the pub, or the fact it took him and <a href="http://blog.meriwilliams.com">Meri</a> quite a while with the instructions to put it together.</p>

 <p>Some people have been saying that the socialising is getting in the way of the learning and sundry at these conferences. I&#8217;ve got to disagree. You just cant ignore the socialising, not when it&#8217;s this much fun. But that doesn&#8217;t mean the message doesn&#8217;t get drilled home too.</p>
