<p>Well, Christian&#8217;s book, <a href="http://www.beginningjavascript.com">Begining Javascript with DOM Scripting and Ajax</a> is out and, as of writing this <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1590596803/202-8465886-9794241?v=glance&#38;n=266239">Amazon UK</a> only have four copies left so hopefully that&#8217;s a good sign.</p>


 <p>A quick competition on the site peaked my amusometer and I couldn&#8217;t resist.</p>

 <p>Keep an eye on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/newcoverforbeginningjavascript/">flickr</a> for more hopefully.</p>


 <p><a href="http://simon.incutio.com/">Everyone</a> <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com">who</a> <a href="http://www.paulhammond.org/journal/">is</a> <a href="http://cackhanded.net/">everyone</a> already resides at YAHOO!, with more <a href="http://allinthehead.com/">recent</a> <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/">movers</a> that you can shake a stick at.  I&#8217;d just like to make a couple of observations:</p>


 <p>Both <a href="http://allinthehead.com/retro/297/joining-yahoo">Drew</a> and <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2006/07/12/joining-yahoo/">Stuart</a> posted posts titled <strong>Joining Yahoo!</strong>. The brain washing obviously starts in the interviews so you have been warned!</p>


 <p>The upcoming <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon">BarCampLondon</a> event is being held at the Yahoo offices in London. I&#8217;m thinking about going along, but I&#8217;m scared Yahoo might not let all those talented developers leave on the sunday?</p>
