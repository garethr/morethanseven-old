title: "Mac Virtualhost follow up"
---

<p>A couple of people asked for the details of the virtualhost script I modified for use with MAMP in a <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/virtualhosts-on-mac-os-x#comment">previous post</a>. Apologies for taking a bit of time.</p>


 <p>First I had to make these changes to the original <a href="http://patrickgibson.com/utilities/virtualhost/">virtualhost script</a>:</p>


<code>
DOC_ROOT_PREFIX="/Applications/MAMP/htdocs" 
</code>

<code>
<pre>APACHE_CONFIG="/Applications/MAMP/conf/apache" 
APACHECTL="/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/apachectl"</pre>
</code>

 <p>I also made a few changes to httpd.conf in /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache. From memory first to allow local .htaccess files to override everything on a per directory basis.</p>


<code>
<pre>&lt;Directory "/Applications/MAMP/htdocs"&gt;
oAllowOverride All
&lt;/Directory&gt;</pre>
</code>

 <p>and then to point to the virtual hosts directory.</p>


<code>
<pre>NameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1
Include /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/virtualhosts</pre>
</code>

 <p>I keep meaning to do a screen capture tutorial of sorts, so maybe something like this would be a good starting point? We shall see as and when time permits. Probably this time next year. Any problems let me know and I&#8217;ll try and debug.</p>
