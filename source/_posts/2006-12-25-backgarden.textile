<p>I&#8217;m a fan of <a href="http://backpackit.com">Backpack</a> from <a href="http://37signals.com">37signals</a>. Although you <em>can</em> make pages public their is currently no way to style those differently, or to add content from outside Backpack. That&#8217;s where Backgarden comes in. It&#8217;s a simple PHP (4 and 5, the XML/XSL implementations are slighly different) application that builds a page via the Backpack API and some XSL magic that you can put on your site. You just enter the page address and your API key.</p>
