<p>Having just moved from a couple of year old <a href="http://textpattern.com">Textpattern</a> site to <a href="http://radiantcms.org">Radiant</a> I didn&#8217;t feel much like copy and pasting lots of articles. The script simply copies all your posts from textpattern into the relevant place in Radiant.</p>

<p><a href="/_assets/downloads/txp2radiant/txp2radiant.phps">Download PHP</a></p>

<p>At the moment this is undocumented and pretty rough but it saved me time and works. I&#8217;ll try and work up and potentially rewrite in Ruby for possible inclusion in the Radiant core if time permits.</p>
