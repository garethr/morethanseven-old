<p><a href="http://webpy.org">Web.py</a> is a really nice lightweight web framework written in Python. It&#8217;s not trying to be Rails or Django, it&#8217;s trying to be as simple as possible. Web.php is my homage to Web.py. I&#8217;ve unashamedly copied the ideas and build a very simple web framework in PHP. It&#8217;s not a complete port, nor does it do everything in the same way.</p>

<p>The code example from the project home page was what originally piqued my interest:</p>

<pre><code>import web
urls = (
   '/(.*)', 'hello'
)
class hello:        
   def GET(self, name):
       i = web.input(times=1)
       if not name: name = 'world'
       for c in xrange(int(i.times)): print 'Hello,', name+'!'
if __name__ == "__main__": web.run(urls, globals())</code></pre>

<p>My PHP versions goes something like this, I&#8217;m sure you can see the similarities:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
require('webphp/web.php');
$urls = array(
   '/' =&gt; 'hello',
);
class hello {
   function GET($path) {
      echo 'hello world';
   }
}
web::run($urls);
?&gt;</code></pre>

<p>I&#8217;ve used it so far on a couple of projects, but it&#8217;s never been properly tested as such nor do I have lots of time to develop it. It&#8217;s purposely feature and code light (the core file is only 80 odd lines of code, includig comments).</p>
