<p>Their is nothing wrong with a nice header graphic. Clients, designers and customers alike love them. But I often see them used as an excuse for fixed width designs. Well no more I say (unless, of course you have a perfectly good reason for a fixed width design in which case you dont really need this technique.)</p>

<p>The plan was simple. Find a way of incorporating flash headers into sites using liquid or elastic designs in much the same way you might use lots of sliding doors background-image goodness.</p>

<p>And all it takes is a snippet of actionscript goodness:</p>


<pre><code>Stage.scaleMode = "noScale" 
Stage.align = "TL" 
var width
var height
function resizeEvent ( ) {
    width = Stage.width
    height = Stage.height
    dimensions.text    = 
       'width : ' + width+ '
        height : ' + height
    topRight._x = width
    bottomLeft._y = height
    bottomRight._y = height
    bottomRight._x = width
}
resizeEvent ( )
var stageListener = new Object ( );
stageListener.onResize = resizeEvent
Stage.addListener ( stageListener );</code></pre>
