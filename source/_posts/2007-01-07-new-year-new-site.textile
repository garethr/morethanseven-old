<p>If you&#8217;re viewing this post in your feedreader then you might not notice anything different but it&#8217;s all change around these parts. I&#8217;ve gone all <a href="http://radiantcms.org">Radiant</a> and with it a new slightly minimal design.</p>


 <p>Radiant, for those that missed my earlier gushing post is a Rails based Content Management System that looks something like this:</p>


 <p><img src="/_assets/media/imgRadiantAdmin.png" alt="Morethanseven admin panel from Radiant" /></p>


 <p>I&#8217;m going to post a few follow ups about how I did certain things using Radiant and my particular setup. All in all it&#8217;s been fun. Always a good sign when developing something. I ported all my old posts across from Textpattern and I&#8217;ve posted a project post (in my new <a href="http://morethanseven.net/projects-feed">project feed</a>) about <a href="http://morethanseven.net/projects/txp2radiant">TXP2Radiant</a> for anyone else looking to do the same.</p>


 <p>Their will likely be a few gremlins lying around that I&#8217;ll get to over the coming weeks, and I have some decent posts in mind to keep people interested. Expect less about what I&#8217;m up to and more about the pressing issues of web design and development that I keep meaning to write about.</p>


 <p>The design is a little on the minimal side at the moment but on purpose. I want to play around with different designs for the site while keeping everything clean and simple. I might even set a file size limit for the CSS and I definately want to start playing more with CSS3 selectors (more than 80% of you dont use IE6, for the other 20% <em>please</em> upgrade). I&#8217;m not going to say anything I&#8217;d regret, like one new design every other month, but I can dream.</p>


 <p>As I get more familiar with Rails (one of the reasons for the move) and Radiant I&#8217;ll likely add some bits like a <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> powered gallery and maybe something to do with <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> but for the moment it&#8217;s all about the content.</p>
