<p>If you visited the site previously since the Radiant move you might notice a new colour scheme. Come to mention it if you visit tomorrow, or the day after you should get a different colour scheme too.</p>


 <p>I mentioned that I planned on a few experiments around these parts and this is the first one. I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="http://www.firewheeldesign.com/widgets/">ColorBurn</a> from <a href="http://www.firewheeldesign.com/">Firewheel</a>. For those that haven&#8217;t seen it it&#8217;s a desktop widget that displays a new four colour colour scheme every day that looks a little something like:</p>

 <p>I often use it for inspiration for colour sets, or just to appreciate interesting colour combinations. This just takes it a step further. A little reverse engineering and I have a script (PHP this time, running from a cron job) that writes out a new stylesheet once every day with the colours from ColorBurn (using the magic of XSL if you&#8217;re interested). I&#8217;ve used an alpha transparency on the image to the top left of the page which might result in strange effects in browsers that I dont care about too much. Sorry, but I did warn you.</p>


 <p>I have a feeling that some days I&#8217;ll wake up and regret this experiment and others I&#8217;ll be pleasantly suprised. I&#8217;m not going to cheat either. ColorBurn provides me with four colours and the script will use them in the order they come in.</p>
