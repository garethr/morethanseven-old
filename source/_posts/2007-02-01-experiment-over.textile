<p>Ok, well, that was interesting I thought. For those that haven&#8217;t followed along on the site I thought I&#8217;d recap some of the weird and wonderful colour schemes that have been used on this site as part of my experiment with <a href="http://www.firewheeldesign.com/widgets/">colorburn</a></p>
