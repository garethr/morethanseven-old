title: "Content Management Systems a go-go"
---

Well, I'm now running "WordPress":http://wordpress.org. I know I appear to be aimlessly flitting between content management systems on this site but it's more of a little research project I swear. Hopefully it's all happening pretty seemlessly for everyone reading my ramblings. This time RSS came to the fore, allowing me to simply export a feed of all my previous posts and import them straight into WordPress. This sort of portability is very very nice for the user. I'd love to see this sort of functionality for hierachically structured data in larger enterprise systems.

I've got Wordpress up and running with a few choice plugins and a new theme in a couple of days which is nice. Hopefully any minor issues will be ironed out as I find them. An added bonus is comments are now back, I've got so many things to rave about after getting back from "BarCamp":http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon2 and "Future of Web Apps":http://futureofwebapps.com that letting anyone else point out the errors is only fair.
