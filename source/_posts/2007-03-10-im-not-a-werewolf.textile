title: "I&#39;m not a Werewolf!"
---

After the numerous games of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(game) ">Werewolf</a> at "Barcamp London":http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon2 recently a few of us "got chatting":http://kid666.com/blog/2007/02/19/werewolf-cards/ about the idea of custom Werewolf cards using "Flickr":http://flickr.com. Well I've just finished a very simple example of this and thought I'd post it up.

Head over to "morethanseven.net/presents/werewolf":http://morethanseven.net/presents/werewolf for a set of printable cards based on Flickr Machine Tags.

In the future I may enhance this with a nifty interface which lets visitors select the number of each card they want - and I spoke briefly with "Stefan":http://www.whitelabel.org/ from "Moo":http://www.moo.com/ about if it's possible to link into printing them on those lovely Moo cards.

If you want anyone to appear just add the relevant werewolf machine tag!
