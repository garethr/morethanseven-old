title: "Software I Installed on my N800"
---

Ok, so I've been shopping again but I'll try and make this post a little more useful that _oh, look at my shiny new toy_.

I decided that what I was really missing to help with my "twitter":http://twitter.com addiction and growing interest in the mobile web was a shiny new Nokia N800 Internet Tablet.

I cant really write a fair review at the moment as I've only just got my mits on it so that will have to save for later. All I can think at the moment is _"Oh, shiny"_. What I will do is list the software I installed on it from the start, partly to demonstrate what you can get on it, partly to link to thinks I found useful and mostly to remind me if and when I need to do it again.

And just for "Phil":http://anotherblog.com it already has GCC-3.4-base on so no need to install.

Oh, and for the nay sayers thinking iPhone I don't care. From all I've read the iPhone is going to be a closed system and this is a full blown Linux OS that is designed expressly to be hackable. Plus the N800 makes people swoon now, not in six months or a year when the iPhone hits the shelves.
