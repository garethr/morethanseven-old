title: "Newcastle Geekvenues"
---

More interesting Newcastle centric news, although this time partly releveant to everyone else - well, as long as you live in Oxford, Brighton, Leeds or Manchester that this.

"Natalie Downe":http://notes.natbat.net/ has spent some of her copious spare time (having left the agency way of life and gone all "freelance":http://notes.natbat.net/2007/08/19/freelance/ too) cooking up "Geekvenues":http://geekvenues.com/. It's an attempt to map (using Google Maps) any and all geek related venues around the UK. Local meetup places perhaps, regular venues, or just geek friendly pubs with wifi.

I've been adding some venues for Newcastle and they can be found over at "newcastle.geekvenues.com/":http://newcastle.geekvenues.com/. If anyone knows of any other ones let me know. And if anyone is thinking "I want it to cover my neck of the woods" then get in touch with Nat, ideally with a link to a KML file of locations. I'm looking at "Alan":http://www.azcazandco.com and "John":http://sneeu.com/blog/ from Edinburgh in particular here.
