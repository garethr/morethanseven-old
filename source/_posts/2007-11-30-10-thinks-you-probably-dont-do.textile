The resent "barcamplondon3":http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon was huge fun and particularly interesting. I might even go as far as saying it was the best yet in terms of the sessions I attended.

Particular highlights for me included discussions of (Yahoo! flavoured) web development practices and processes from "Norm":http://cackhanded.net and "Mike":http://isolani.co.uk/, "Matt Biddulph":http://hackdiary.com on messaging, erlang a event driven programming techniques and "Dan Dixon's":http://www.digitaldust.org/ panel on What should we be teaching the next gen of web designers/devs?

I tried to kick off a debate regarding automation and software tools and practices in web projects. More from anecdotal evidence and experience rather than pure research I don't think that many companies or individuals really set their projects up on a solid base. Source control, bug tracking, scripted builds, automated quality testing, etc. aren't that common for smaller or medium web projects.

In the end I talked though everything in general terms and the audience nicely jumped in with various platform specific toolsets for unit testing, functional testing and performance measurement. All in all good fun and a subject I think will see some activity next year.

Overall a good smattering of my favourite topics at the moment (education, development process, distributed messaging), lots of fun people and the chance to ride round Google on a segway at about two in the morning. Roll on the next barcamp.
