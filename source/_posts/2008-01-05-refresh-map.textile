It turns out that their are now nearly 40 "Refresh":http://www.refreshingcities.org/ groups scattered around and about. Here's a "quick map of them all":http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&ll=43.580391,-56.25&spn=98.199649,202.5&z=2&om=1&msid=103845568847240179832.000442fedc66a55c4744b. It's pretty interesting how all these groups have picked up on a simple word.
