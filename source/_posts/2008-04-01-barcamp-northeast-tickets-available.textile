title: "Barcamp NorthEast tickets available"
---

Quick post to say BarCampNorthEast tickets are now available. We're starting off releasing 50 tickets and we'll see how that goes. We're really not sure how quickly these will disappear so get them while they're hot. More tickets will be available later as well.

The event is looking like its going to be great. I'm really happy we managed to find a venue that would let us do the whole sleeping over thing. And with "Thinking Digital":http://www.thinkingdigital.co.uk/ the week before and rumours of a geekdinner on the friday night it's going to be busy few days in Newcastle. 

We're still on the lookout for a few sponsors as well so if anyone is interested in sponsorship opportunities, or just has a few questions feel free to <a href="mailto:gareth@morethanseven.net">drop me a line</a>.
