title: "Design Strategies for a Distributed Web"
---

I just finished my presentation on the last day of the Xtech conference in Dublin. I'd chosen to ramble on about the advantages, problems and a few solutions of building applications atop of lots of APIs. The presentation is now up on "slideshare":http://slideshare.net at "slideshare.net/garethr/design-strategies-for-a-distributed-web/":http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/design-strategies-for-a-distributed-web/.

Lots of interesting conversations have been occurring all week and a few people have mentioned a near barcamp feel at times. It's a pretty small, clued-up, technical audience and as always some of the best bits have been conversations in the corridors.
"Jeremy":http://adactio.com has been "live blogging many of the talks":http://adactio.com/journal/tag/xtech08 which should be a worth a read later on. Although with three tracks most of the time that's only some of the great talks on offer.
