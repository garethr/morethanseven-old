title: "Google App Engine PyUnit Test Runner"
---

I'm starting to play around with using "App Engine":http://code.google.com/appengine/ again for small projects. It's great for simple, somewhat throwaway apps as long as you don't need anything too fancy. Actually all I want really is long running processes but I digress.

I'm increasingly writing test suites as well for even small projects and was missing the convenience of the Django test runner for running them against App Engine code. So I've spent a little time writing a simple test running script to use for non-Django Python projects. I've posted it over on the "App Engine Cookbook":http://appengine-cookbook.appspot.com/recipe/app-engine-test-runner/ for anyone else who might want to do the same.

I ended up writing something myself as I couldn't find anything else which quite met my needs, so it's the typical programmers itch code and as such is provided as _works for me_ software. The other approaches out their didn't quite meet my needs but might be useful to know about if you want to start testing your apps.

* "Nose GAE":http://code.google.com/p/nose-gae/ uses the nose testing framework which I'm less familiar with.
* "GAE Unit":http://code.google.com/p/gaeunit/ uses PyUnit but presents it's results in a browser rather than on the command line.
