"Jsonpickle":http://code.google.com/p/jsonpickle is a Python library for serializing any arbitrary object graph into JSON. The advantage over something like simplejson is the _arbitrary_ part, simplejson throws errors when you try and serialize some types of objects. I also prefer the jsonpickle API (encode, decode) over simplejson (dump, dumps, load, loads).
