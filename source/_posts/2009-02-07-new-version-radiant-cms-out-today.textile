title: "New Version of Radiant CMS Out Today"
---

Via "tagging a new release":http://github.com/radiant/radiant/tree/master on GitHub I see a new version of "Radiant":http://radiantcms.org/ (0.7) has been released. Radiant is a really nice CMS for smaller projects, it's used on the official "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/ site and I used it here at one point.

Go check out the "blog post for the full list of the changes":http://radiantcms.org/blog/archives/2009/02/07/radiant-0-7-0---intaglio-release-final/.
