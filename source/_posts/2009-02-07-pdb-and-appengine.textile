It turns out App Engine breaks the default behaviour of the Python debugger PDB by sending STDOUT to the browser. But with a "little bit of python":http://jjinux.blogspot.com/2008/05/python-debugging-google-app-engine-apps.html you can put it back in.

pre. import sys
import pdb
for attr in ('stdin', 'stdout', 'stderr'):
    setattr(sys, attr, getattr(sys, '__%s__' % attr))
pdb.set_trace()
