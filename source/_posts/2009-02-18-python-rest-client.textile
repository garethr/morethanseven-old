title: "Python REST Client"
---

I'm working on a small project involving using RESTful APIs and wanted a simple HTTP client, something that sat a little higher in the stack than "httplib2":http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/ or similar. I turned initially to the "Django Test Client":http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/models/test_client/ which now "supports all the required methods":http://code.google.com/p/python-rest-client/ but it turned out that I'd have to unpick it from django a little.

With a little bit of looking around I found the "python-rest-client":http://code.google.com/p/python-rest-client/ which certainly sounded like it would do what I wanted. It lets you make HTTP requests in as straight forward a manner as possible and fitted the bill perfectly.

pre. from restful_lib import Connection
conn = Connection("http://morethanseven.net")
response = conn.request_get("/")

It supports authentication, nice helper methods and gives you the response in a nice format.

pre. conn = Connection("http://example.org", username="XXX", password="XXX")
conn.request_delete('/items/11232344')

As an added benefit it also comes with a Google App Engine compatible version.
