I gave a short presentation about App Engine last night at the "Cambridge Python User Group":http://campug.org.uk/ and as always it's available on "Slideshare":http://slideshare.net.

I find App Engine a great way of just writing (Python) code and putting it online quickly, and the presentation was aimed at being something of a fanboy ode. During questions afterwards we talked about some of the limitations and cases where App Engine isn't as well suited, and at least a few people were heading off planning on having a play.

The event was good fun and I picked up a few Python related tips and tricks from the other presentations and general conversation. Thanks for everyone who organised and attended the event and to "RealVNC":http://www.realvnc.com/ for hosting the talks.
