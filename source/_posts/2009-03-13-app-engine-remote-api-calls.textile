Not sure how I missed this but apparently App Engine (as of 1.1.9) supports "remote access to your live data store":http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/remote_api.html. This means you can create administration applications more easily by running them locally, rather than within the limitations of the live platform. You can even run a local python prompt with access to your live datastore which is pretty neat.
