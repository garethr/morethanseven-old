I've been playing again with App Engine, and going back to an on/off pet project that I've build variations of for a while.

<a href="http://hackerposts.appspot.com"><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRihHww" alt="Hacker Posts"/></a>

It's basically a pretty straightforward aggregation platform, taking content from a number of feeds and creating relationships between the items. It's mainly an experiment in creating a decent size site on App Engine - it can be surprising how many urls you can get out of a good corpus of data:

* 400 items, each with a unique url
* each item has a variable number of tags generated, at the moment that amounts to about 1000 unique urls
* each month and year of content gets a url so that's another 4 or so
* each day for which we have items we also get a url, so that's another 90 or so

So starting off with 1500 or so pages isn't bad. The site also grows over time as new items are posted or I add more feeds. Everything else I've done with App Engine has been more "application":http://imified-demo.appspot.com/ "focused":http://image-host.appspot.com/ so seeing how a content site performs is interesting in and of itself.

The data in question I used for this first experiment was the feeds I could find from the "top posters on Hacker News":http://news.ycombinator.com/leaders. Hence the name "Hacker Posts":http://hackerposts.appspot.com. That left me with 35 feeds:

I have a couple of other communities or events that I'd like to do the same thing around, as well as a few features I want to add to the underlying software. The nice thing with App Engine is rolling new instances out is as simple as running a command.
