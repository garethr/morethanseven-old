Just saw this and thought it was cool. You can "link to a specific line, or set of lines":http://github.com/garethr/booky/blob/08615163198a2b51353aeba07f25ec9ed477d60c/src/booky/lib/builder.py#L17-24 on GitHub. All you need to do is append something like #L17-24 to specify highlighting lines 17 to 24.
