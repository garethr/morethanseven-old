title: "Keeping Up With The Zeldmans - (Self) Education for Web Professionals"

So, it was the "Bamboo Juice":http://www.bamboojuice.co.uk/ conference last Friday at the rather impressive Eden project in Cornwall. Along with "Jeremy":http://adactio.com, "Dom":http://www.thehodge.co.uk/, "Paul":http://boagworld.com/ and "Relly":http://www.scatteredpoppies.com/ I presented to the crowd of mainly local first time web conference goers.

It was a great event, and felt a lot like the first Highland Fling in that it was the first big event in an area that's actually quite a distance from the bright lights of London (it took 8 hours to get back to Cambridge). The party afterwards, held in one of the biomes at the Eden project itself, was also pretty impressive.

I'll hopefully right up some of my notes from the presentation soon, but for the moment I've "uploaded the slides to Slideshare":http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/self-education-for-web-professionals. The whole thing was video'd as well so look out for those in the future.
