title: "Testing WSGI Application with Urltest"
---

I found myself wanted something to make writing high level, functional tests for WSGI application easier and quicker. If I liked the term I'd call it a domain specific language for testing URLs. Basically I found myself writing a lot of tests like:

pre. def test_404_handler(self):  
    response = self.app.get('/does-not-exist', expect_errors=True)        
    self.assertEquals("404 Not Found", response.status)

Testing more than a view URLs like this got boring quickly. What I wanted was a short hand syntax for defining this sort of simple test and then running them all individually. So was born "Urltest":http://github.com/garethr/urltest/tree/master. It uses the rather nifty "Webtest":http://pypi.python.org/pypi/WebTest/0.9 module and hooks into unittest from the standard library. You're test script then looks a little like:

pre. #!/usr/bin/env python
from example_app import application
from urltest import verify_urls
if __name__ == "__main__":
    urls = (
        {'url':"/", 'code':200},
        {'url':"/bob", 'code':200},
        {'url':"/jim", 'code':404},
        {'url':"/jim", 'method': "POST", 'code':405},
    )    
    verify_urls(urls, application)

Let me know if you use it as at the moment this is _works for me_ ware, although it's reasonably well tested and commented.
