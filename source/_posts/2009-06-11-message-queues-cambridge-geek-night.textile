title: "Message Queues at Cambridge Geek Night"
---

Last night was the first Cambridge Geek Night and saw 35 people or so fill a room above a pub to listen to a few short talks and converse with fellow geeks. I had the pleasure of giving the first talk, a short introduction to using message queues for web developers.

I got lots of good questions from interested people and by the sounds of things it had the desired effect - for people unfamiliar with using a message queue to go out and have a play with some of the cool software available to solve your problems.

Overall the night was definitely a success. Suitably geeky conversations. A chance to meet new people as well as old friends. Good job "Vero":http://www.thatcanadiangirl.co.uk/ and "David":http://blog.fatbusinessman.com/ for organising the event and here's to the next one.
