Ruby people _really_ don't like CSS do they? But "Less":http://lesscss.org/ is actually pretty cool. It's basically an attempt to bootstrap features, specifically Variables, Mixins, Operations and Nested Rules, into CSS. The best part about this is it uses CSS syntax and a simple one step compiler. I'd be interested to know what the folks at the W3C think about this.

So for instance you can do:

pre. /* LESS */
@brand_color: #4D926F;
#header {
  color: @brand_color;
}
h2 {
  color: @brand_color;
}

and compile it down to:

pre. /* CSS */
#header {
  color: #4D926F;
}
h2 {
  color: #4D926F;
}
