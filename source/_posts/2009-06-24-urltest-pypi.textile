I've been meaning to add some of my code to the "Python Package Index":http://pypi.python.org for a while and  have finally gotten around to it with "Urltest":http://github.com/garethr/urltest/tree/master, my simple DSL for testing WSGI apps.

You can now find it at "pypi.python.org/pypi/urltest":http://pypi.python.org/pypi/urltest and install it using setuptools with:

pre. easy_install urltest

At the moment I've not added any categorisation or detailed description to the setup.py file, I'll be doing that soon. I wanted to get it working with the absolute minimum setup.py file, which turned out to look like:

pre. #!/usr/bin/env python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages
setup(
    name = "urltest",
    version = "0.1",
    author = "Gareth Rushgrove",
    author_email = "gareth@morethanseven.net",    
    url = "http://github.com/garethr/urltest",
    packages = find_packages('src'),
    package_dir = {'':'src'},
)

Uploading it to PYPI itself was incredibly simple, partly as I was already using setup tools for local installation.

pre. python setup.py register
python setup.py bdist_egg upload

Let me know if anyone uses this and gets it working. I'll be adding more details and maybe even some more features when I get the chance. Once I do that I'll probably work on a few more packages as well.
