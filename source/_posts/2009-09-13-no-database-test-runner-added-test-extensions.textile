title: "No database test runner added to test extensions"
---

Thanks to "Brad":http://intranation.com/ I've just released a new version of "Django Test Extensions":http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-test-extensions/0.5 (also on "GitHub":http://github.com/garethr/django-test-extensions with support for running tests without the overhead of setting up and tearing down the database. Django still has a few places were it assumes you'll have a database somewhere in your project - and the default test runner is one of them.
