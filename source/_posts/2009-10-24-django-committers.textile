I've been lurking on the django-developers mailing list for the last couple of weeks and that provided an excuse to play with the "new Twitter Lists":http://blog.twitter.com/2009/09/soon-to-launch-lists.html feature. So here's a "list of djangocommitters on twitter":http://twitter.com/garethr/djangocommitters. If I missed someone do let me know. Their is a chance you won't be able to see this if you're not on the beta yet I think, sorry!
