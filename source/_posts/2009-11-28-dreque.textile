I've just found "Dreque":http://github.com/samuel/dreque from "Samuel Stauffer":http://samuelks.com/ on GitHub. It's yet another take on the whole messaging things which is definitely seeing a lot of activity at the back end of this year. It's using "Redis":http://code.google.com/p/redis/ on the backend and looks really rather nice:

Submitting jobs:

<pre><code>from dreque import Dreque
def some_job(argument):
    pass
dreque = Dreque("127.0.0.1")
dreque.enqueue("queue", some_job, argument="foo")</code></pre>

Worker:

<pre><code>from dreque import DrequeWorker
worker = DrequeWorker(["queue"], "127.0.0.1")
worker.work()</code></pre>
