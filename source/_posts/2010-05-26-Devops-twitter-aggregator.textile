title: "Devops Twitter Aggregator"
---

I've been hacking on appengine again and have thrown up a simple "twitter aggregator for devops":http://devopstweets.appspot.com/. It's again based on "TwitterEngine":http://github.com/steffentchr/twitterengine with an increasing number of additions and changes.

As well as just the tweets I want to build a few other small features. The first of which is link extraction, so at the moment you'll see recent links a the top of the page. I'll hopefully make that a little more useful, with better browing and converting short urls into the real ones. I also have vague plans for providing exports, listing people talking about devops and some useful graphs to track general activity around devops.

I'm really interested to see if the whole discussion around the term devops grows over the next year or so, and I'm hoping this will make it a little easier to see that change happen.
