title: "Git Pre Recieve Hook For Integrity"
---

I'm getting married rather soon so time has been somewhat short (in a good way) for just hacking on stuff, but I've finally found a little bit of time to play with something I've been mulling over for a while. Namely a continuous deployment workflow using the integrity continous integration server.

I'm hoping to have an incredibly simple but fully operation example available at some point - mainly to act as a good discussion point. For now here's my current pre-receive hook.
