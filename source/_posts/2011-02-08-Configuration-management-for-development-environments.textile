I had the pleasure of speaking at "Fosdem":http://www.fosdem.org/2011/ last weekend to a packed "Configuration amd systems management devroom":http://www.fosdem.org/2011/schedule/track/configuration_systems_management_devroom.

My presentation covered some of the same ground as recent blog posts, namely why you should be using virtualisation and config management tools to manage your local development environment.

People even said "nice things":http://twitter.com/#!/unixdaemon/status/34209307390124033 about it:

bq. @garethr basically has this subject completely covered. He's even advocating the correct editor. excellent #fosdem talk

All in all another good event, I have notes about some of the other talks I went along to that I'll try write up soon.
