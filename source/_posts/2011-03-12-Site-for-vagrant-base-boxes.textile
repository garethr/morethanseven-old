title: "Site For Vagrant Base Boxes"
---

A brief "conversation with Matt Keating":https://twitter.com/#!/garethr/status/40785392445685760 on Twitter finally pushed me over the edge and I've built a site I'd been meaning to do for a while.

I'm a huge "Vagrant":http://vagrantup.com fan, but one thing that often comes up is where to find base boxes. My newly launched site "Vagranbox.es":http://vagrantbox.es provides just that. At the moment that just means user submitted boxes being checked and then posted. I'll likely add comments and ratings and the like if things become popular but that's for later.

So, if you know of or host a useful box please let me know. I'll try to keep up with any submissions.
