Since I launched it back in November my "Devops Weekly":http://devopsweekly.com email has been pretty well received I think. Folks on twitter seem to like it, as do a few people I've met at recent events who have said nice things. One thing a few people have been after though is an online archive, either because email just doesn't work for them or more often because they missed out on the earlier issues.

With a little time this weekend and the help of "Jekyll":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll I've just added the seventeen issÂ§ues to date to the new "Devops Weekly archive":http://devopsweekly.com/archive. I'd have liked to do something a bit more useful, maybe introduce per link tags or a nifty search feature, but I'm pretty busy at present and reason this should serve the main purpose of getting these links online.
