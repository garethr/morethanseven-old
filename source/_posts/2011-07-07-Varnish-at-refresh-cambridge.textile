title: "Varnish At Refresh Cambridge"
---

I did a quick lightning talk at the Refresh Cambridge meetup last night, a very quick introduction to "Varnish":https://www.varnish-cache.org/. Given 10 minutes all I really wanted to do was get people to go away and take a look at it. Lots of folks in the room hadn't come across it before so I think the talk was hopefully well pitched.

Several people asked about slighly dynamic pages and I only got chance to mention support for "ESI":https://www.varnish-cache.org/trac/wiki/ESIfeatures (Edge Side Includes) at the end. Conversation afterwards turned to various parts of the modern web stack and I had a pretty good time being opinionated. Hopefully more of the same next month.
