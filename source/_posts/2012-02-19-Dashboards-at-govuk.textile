title: "Dashboards At Gov.Uk"

This is a bit of a cheat blog post really. I've been crazy busy all month with little time for anything except work (specifically shipping the first release of "www.gov.uk":https://www.gov.uk/). I have had a little time to blog over on the Cabinet Office blog though, about work we've done with dashboards.

If you're ever looking for good little hack projects dashboards are perfect, and often hugely useful once up and running. Convincing people of this before you have a few in the office might be hard - so just build something simple in a lunch break and find a screen to put it on. We've had great feedback from ours, both from people wandering through the office and from our colleagues who have a better idea of what's going on.
