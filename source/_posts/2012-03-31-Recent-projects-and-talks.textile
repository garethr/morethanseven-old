I've been pretty busy with all things "GOV.UK":https://www.gov.uk recently but I've managed to get a few bits of unrelated code up and a few talks in. I'm _still_ pretty busy so here's a list of some of them rather than a proper blog post.

* "Puppet Data Mining":http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/mining-puppet talk from last weeks PuppetCamp in Edinburgh. 
* "Introducting Web Operations":http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/web-operations talk I gave at work to give my mainly non-development colleagues an idea about what it's all about.
* "Learning from building GOV.UK":http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/learnings-from-govuk talk I gave a month back or so to Cambridge Geek Night. We did an excellent full project retrospective after the beta launch and this lists some of the things we learnt.

After someone bugged me on Twitter I realised the small bit of code we've been using for our Nagios dashboard wasn't out in the wild. So introducing "Nash":https://github.com/garethr/nash, a very simple high level check dashboard which screenscrapes nagiosand runs happily on Heroku.

Although I've not been writing too much on here I've been keeping "Devops Weekly":http://devopsweekly.com/ going each week for over a year now. I've just crossed 3000 subscribers which is pretty neat for a pet project.
