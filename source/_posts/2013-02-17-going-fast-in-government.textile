About a month ago I had the good fortune of speaking at the "London Web Performance":http://www.meetup.com/London-Web-Performance-Group/ meetup. This was one of the first talks I've done about our work at The Government Digital Service since the luanch of GOV.UK back in October. The topic was all about moving quickly in a large organisation (The UK Civil Service is about 450,000 people so I think it counts) and featured just a hand full of technical and organisational tricks we used.
