While at [Craft](http://craft-conf.com/2014) I decided to have a quick look at
[Consul](http://www.consul.io/), a new service discovery framework with
a few intersting features. One of the main selling points is a DNS
interface with a nice API. The [Introduction](http://www.consul.io/intro/index.html)
shows how to use this via the dig command line tool, but how do you use
a custom internal DNS server without modifying all your applications?
One answer to this question is
[Dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html).

I'm not explaining Consul here, the above mentioned introduction does a
good job of stepping through the setup. The following assumes you have
installed and started consul.

## Installation and configuration

I'm running these examples on an Ubuntu 14.04 machine, but dnsmasq
should be available and packaged for lots of different operating
systems.

```bash
apt-get install dnsmasq
```

Once installed we can create a very simple configuration.

```bash
echo "server=/consul/127.0.0.1#8600" > /etc/dnsmasq.d/10-consul
```

All we're doing here is specifying that DNS requests for consul services
are to be dealt with by the DNS server at 127.0.0.1 on port 8600. Unless
you've changed the consul defaults this should work.

Just in case you prefer Puppet their is already a handy
[dnsmasq](https://github.com/saz/puppet-dnsmasq) module. The resulting
puppet code then looks like this.

```puppet
include dnsmasq
dnsmasq::conf { 'consul':
  ensure  => present,
  content => 'server=/consul/127.0.0.1#8600',
}
```

## Usage

The examples from the main documentation specify a custom DNS server for
dig like so:

```bash
dig @127.0.0.1 -p 8600 web.service.consul
```

With Dnsmasq installed and configured as above you should just be able
to do the following:

```bash
dig web.service.consul
```

And now any of your existing applications will be able to use your
consul instance for service discovery via DNS.
